                        <p> By <span class="byline">Tim Clarke</span> </p>
                </div>
                
                </header>
            
                <p> <span class="dropcap">T</span>hey were odd individuals, but an even more odd couple. </p>
                
                <p>Jemma Lilley, with her blue and green-streaked hair, black attire and band T-shirts, and Trudi Lenon, the frumpy housewife with a new friend she seemingly doted on.</p>
                
                <p>There were 17 years between them — and Lenon had a son who should have had more in common with Lilley than his mother.</p>
                
                <p>But after the two women met at the start of last year, their friendship became a fatal attraction and they were bound together by dominance and submission, fantasy and violent, deviant desires.</p>
                
                <p>Lilley had always been a bit strange. Hailing from the Stamford area of Lincolnshire in Britain, she had grown up with pain and dysfunction in the home because of her mother.</p>
                
                <p>Depression and mental health issues led to an abusive, traumatic childhood, which in turn led a young Lilley towards the darker side of life.</p>
                
                <p>Horror became a haven. </p>
                
                <p>A Nightmare on Elm Street will scare and horrify most people. Its central character is Freddy Krueger, a hideously burnt serial killer who targets people in their dreams with a glove made of knives.</p>
                
                <p>But when Lilley saw that character as a child she thought of him as a “protector”.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>“He was my protector when I was young, ” Lilley said. “A young child is someone who needed protecting, a guardian angel ... I had Freddy and would rather have someone that can defend me. Everything is perfect if I get to hug Freddy.”</p>
                
                <p>As Lilley got older, her interest in violence, knives and murder — and those who commit it — crystallised.</p>
                
                <p>And when she arrived in Australia in 2010, she had already committed a large part of that fascination to paper.</p>
                
                <p>Using a college assignment as the catalyst, Lilley embarked on a book which, in her estimation, would be so violent and vile that her lecturers would not want to read it. </p>
                
                <p>She called it Playzone, but there was nothing playful about it — or the author.</p>
                
                <p>Living in the northern suburbs of Perth, Lilley put her artistic bent to work at a tattoo parlour in Girrawheen. And when her visa was about to run out, she found someone to help her out — a gay friend called Gordon whom she married.</p>
                
                <p>Coincidentally, Gordon bore a striking resemblance to the American serial killer John Wayne Gacy, which became his nickname. His best friend was Kim Taylor, with whom Lilley shared some sexual encounters, even though she said she had no interest in sex.</p>
                
                <p>And Kim had a friend called Trudi.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>“The first kill is actually going to happen, and Corvina will stand back ... ready to take control of the clean up, while SOS comes back to reality.”</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>Living with her former brother-in-law in Medina with her two young sons, Trudi Lenon, like Lilley, looked from the outside to be an ordinary woman living a life slightly outside the mainstream in Perth’s outer suburbs.</p>
                
                <p>She had her boys and friends and a social life, and an issue with her weight.</p>
                
                <p>But she also had a past, which involved an engagement in the sordid and secret world of bondage and sadomasochism, where she had played the role of a “submissive” so much so that her former partner had “branded” her with a tattoo of ownership. </p>
                
                <p>She had extricated herself from that relationship but was drifting aimlessly until early last year when, through a mutual friend, she was introduced to Lilley.</p>
                
                <p>Morning coffees turned into morning swims which led to long, online chats on Facebook Messenger, sharing intimate secrets and mostly unspoken desires.</p>
                
                <p>When Lilley visited her new friend at her home in May last year she was shocked at her living conditions. That visit prompted the generous offer of a place to stay for Lenon and her boys until she could find a place of her own.</p>
                
                <p>After that, they seemed to go everywhere together, and Lenon’s sons became attached to their unlikely young landlady.</p>
                
                <p>But there were dangerous elements to their cohabitation. There were knives. The house was littered with them, and not just the cooking and carving variety. There were numerous ornamental daggers, a replica of the knife used by Sylvester Stallone in the Rambo movies, a machete, a sword — and a specialist culinary knife set including a bone saw.</p>

                <figcaption class="par-caption">Police search the Orelia home where Aaron Pajich's body was found.</figcaption>

                <p>The Supreme Court was told that in the weeks after the pair became housemates they became so close that it upset Lenon’s other friends.</p>
                
                <p>They went on camping trips, just the two of them. They watched Game of Thrones and horror movies and a particular favourite of Lilley’s, Dexter, the tale of an apparently intelligent, urbane man who leads a secret parallel life as a vigilante serial killer.</p>
                
                <p>And they exchanged copious messages, feeding into each other’s fantasies of life outside the mundane.</p>
                
                <p>Lilley was SOS, her killer alter ego who in her Playzone book was able to coax others to kill for him. Lenon was Corvina, the persona she adopted in her secret bondage sex life. In that world she had been a submissive. </p>
                
                <p>It was that personality trait that Lilley fed on and fuelled. </p>
                
                <p>“My mind is the darkest being you will ever be laying your life in the hands of, ” Lilley wrote in one message. </p>
                
                <p>“I will fear you but respect you ... I see you as my dominant, ” Lenon said in another. “I am becoming aware of my darkness.”</p>
                
                <p>“The first kill is actually going to happen, ” Lilley wrote, “and Corvina will stand back ... ready to take control of the clean up, while SOS comes back to reality.</p>
                
                <p>“I feel as though I cannot rest until the blood or flesh of a screaming victim is gushing out and pooling on the floor ... I cannot shift this belief that the world has become not only ready for me but it needs me to be ready, ” Lilley said.</p>
                
                <p>“It is definitely time — I am ready, you are ready, ” Lenon replied.</p>
                
                <p>They were ready to kill. And Aaron Pajich was to be their victim.</p>
                
                <H2> Inside the twisted mind of a ‘thrill killer’</h2>

                <p> <span class="dropcap">J</span>emma Lilley liked telling stories. And she thought she was pretty good at it.</p>
                
                <p>The pretty, tattooed young woman had many interests. Serial killers for one, knives for another, and the darkest and bloodiest entertainment material she could find yet another.</p>
                
                <p>Her humble house in Orelia was a shrine to them all.</p>
                
                <p>A sign on the gate into the back garden read Elm Street — a homage to the film and its murderous anti-hero Freddy Krueger with whom she had been besotted since she was six years old.</p>
                
                <p>Inside the house was a Chucky doll, another murderous character from a 1980s slasher film, and a doll of Jigsaw, the central character in the Saw movies whose mission was to concoct increasingly horrifying ways to torture and kill.</p>
                
                <p>Torture was another peccadillo of the 26-year-old Woolworths night fill manager, who moved to Perth in 2010 after emigrating from Britain.</p>
                
                <p>Bone breaking, castration, flagellation, force feeding, scalping, oxygen deprivation: all the methods and more were included in a handwritten alphabetical list found in Lilley’s bedroom — one of hundreds of pages which gave expression to the darkness that consumed her mind.</p>

                    <figcaption>Jemma Lilley posted macabre images on her Facebook wall.</figcaption>
                    
                </div>
               
                <p>The words had been spewing forth for years. Most were in a book, Playzone. It is more than 200 pages of torture, pain and fear bound together by clumsy character development, numerous spelling mistakes and a paper-thin plot.</p>
                
                <p>Graphic images are in the book and on an associated Facebook page. But Lilley was proud of it nonetheless.</p>
                
                <p>Proud because she had completed it despite her dyslexia, which she said meant her mind sometimes moved too quickly for her pen. Proud because she claimed it could spawn sequels and provide the plot for an ultra-violent computer game.</p>
                
                <p>And proud because it gave life to the central character of SOS, a lazy killer who was so charismatic he was able to inspire a “murder cult” where his followers — or maggots — would torture and kill victims in a bid for his admiration.</p>
                
                <p>This was the story Lilley had written and published for sale online, under the pseudonym Syn Demon.</p>
                
                <p>But this was also Lilley’s life story, as her brutally violent fantasy world began to bleed into her reality. “I live like any ... human does. I do my shopping, I go to the laundrette and I go to the park to walk, ” she wrote. </p>
                
                <p>“But doing only that ... just doesn’t fill the void. There had always been something missing in my life, as if I had no purpose of existence. But now I know. I know what my reason for being on this planet is.</p>

                <figcaption class="par-caption">A candlelight vigil for Aaron Pajich in Kwinana.</figcaption>
                
                <p>“Meat is meat. Each body a chance to beat them all, and all failed attempts aren’t really fails when I free the planet from all the pathetic humans like him. The world is over populated as it is. There will be plenty more chances.”</p>
                
                <p>So said SOS — the central, serial-killing character — which she distributed to any friends of acquaintances who showed the slightest bit of interest.</p>
                
                <p>One of those was Trudi Lenon, a dumpy 43-year-old mother of three whose day-to-day life was streaked through with dark fantasy, fetishism and role-playing.</p>
                
                <p>After meeting the younger woman early last year, she said she was more than happy to read the book and to make suggestions about how to make it better.</p>
                
                <p>The book was not the only thing Lilley wrote.</p>
                
                <p>There were articles for the US Serial Killer magazine on Martin Bryant, Australia’s worst mass murderer, and Eric Edgar Cooke, Perth’s most notorious killer.</p>
                
                <p>There was a letter to her idol Robert Englund, who played Krueger, in which she told the actor the killer character had been her “father figure” since she was small.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    
                 <p>“Meat is meat. Each body a chance to beat them all, and all failed attempts aren’t really fails when I free the planet from all the pathetic humans like him. The world is over populated as it is. There will be plenty more chances.”</p>
                    
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>And there were copious scribblings that Lilley claimed were notes for a prequel and a sequel to Playzone — some of which read disturbingly like diary entries of a killer.</p>
                
                <p>In the end, though, it was the written messages to Lenon on Facebook that showed the Supreme Court jury how Lilley was coming to think of herself less and less as Jemma, the night fill manager at a suburban supermarket, and more and more as SOS — the killer with the charm to persuade others to help her murder.</p>
                
                <p>One of her many motorbikes had the numberplate 1SOS1.</p>
                
                <p>Her jacket had SOS stitched into the arm. She had SOS tattooed on her body. </p>
                
                <p>And any piece of artwork she produced was scratched with the distinctive runic representation of her SOS signature.</p>
                
                <p>He was hers, and she was becoming him.</p>
                
                <p>Prosecutors said Lilley eventually did become SOS — acting out her murderous fantasy on vulnerable teen Aaron Pajich, who appeared to be her ideal victim.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>Developmentally challenged because of his autism, apart from his family and prone to wandering, the childlike 18-year-old was a target Lilley thought would not be missed.</p>
                
                <p>But he was. And when Lilley and Lenon were tracked down through phone records, Lilley believed she could make up a story to cover her tracks.</p>
                
                <p>Police saw through her claim that she was on an aimless bike ride to Mundaring on the day Mr Pajich was murdered.</p>
                
                <p>Prosecutor James Mactaggart said the story she told the jury — of being drugged by her housemate and falling asleep during the murder, and how she then built a patio without knowing a body was underneath — was “laughable”.</p>
                
                <p>No one believed it, just as no one had believed her when she said years before she wanted to kill someone before she was 25. Tragically, for Mr Pajich, his parents, family and friends, that story came true.</p>
                
                <p>And the last words of Lilley’s book became horribly prophetic. “Nowadays, people need to understand why. They need a reason for murder ... I for one have none, ” she wrote. Later, she wrote: “ I enjoy my work. I LOVE TO KILL!”</p>
                
                <h2> How a phone call led the police to two killers</h2>
                
                <p> <span class="dropcap">T</span>hey were Bunnings receipts, like those almost every person in Perth would have in their bags or cars or wallets.</p>
                
                <p>But these ones, the ones in Jemma Lilley’s house, were also a shopping list of horror.</p>
                
                <p>There were trips made on May 16, June 3 and, most tellingly, on June 12 last year — the day before Aaron Pajich-Sweetman went missing.</p>
                
                <p>On that day, CCTV showed two women making two purchases at two Bunnings stores at Rockingham and Port Kennedy. Strangely, though, they bought the same product at each shop.</p>
                
                <p>Hydrochloric acid — 40 litres at the first stop and 60 litres at the second.</p>
                
                <p>And there were other items bought before and after. A circular saw. Acetone. Bleach. A large drop sheet. A smaller bottle of acid. A big blue barrel.</p>
                
                <p>All items you might use to renovate your house on a quarter acre block.</p>
                
                <p>Lilley had other uses in mind — a kill and a clean-up.</p>
                
                <p>The kill came on a Monday morning.</p>
                
                <p>It had started as a pretty normal morning for Adrienne Reid, who was still getting used to having her young lodger around but enjoying being his “Lady A”.</p>

                 <figcaption class="par-caption">The Bunnings CCTV footage that helped convict Jemma Lilley and Trudi Lennon.</figcaption>
                
                <p>The young computer games buff had moved in with her on Anzac Day, having met at her local church and he was settling in well.</p>
                
                <p>They were eating breakfast together when Mr Pajich-Sweetman’s phone rang.</p>
                
                <p>He told “Lady A” it was his friend’s mother’s sister Trudi calling.</p>
                
                <p>“His whole face changed when he said, ‘My friend’. He was sure if he went to this woman he would see his friend, ” Ms Reid said.</p>
                
                <p>She could hear the woman offering to come and pick up Mr Pajich-Sweetman but instead, she said she would drop him off at the Rockingham Shopping Centre. And that is where she left him about 9.55am. Lilley and Trudi Lenon were waiting.</p>
                
                <p>On the centre’s CCTV, they looked like two friends getting their chores done — the Department of Transport, a nip into JB Hi-Fi to buy a Polaroid camera, then a wait for the bank to open.</p>
                
                <p>All very mundane. But Lenon was still in contact with the young man she wanted to take home with her, even moving her car to the far part of the carpark in an attempt to seemingly avoid the nosy cameras.</p>
                
                <p>It didn’t work. </p>
                
                <p>Vision from the centre showed Mr Pajich-Sweetman jogging towards his horrible fate, before getting into the car, which CCTV also captured driving away with three people inside — Lenon driving, Lilley in the passenger seat and Aaron in the back.</p>
                
                <p>CCTV of the two women’s own making was also to play a major part in their capture and downfall.</p>

                    <figcaption>18-year-old Aaron Pajich was murdered by Trudi Lennon and Jemma Lilley.</figcaption>

                </div>
                
                <p>With Lilley’s passion for motorcycles — she had up to six bikes in her garage — meaning she also wanted some security, so she installed motion sensor cameras in four spots outside the home.</p>
                
                <p>One of those looked across the blood red patio, which was the commonly used back entrance to the house. </p>
                
                <p>Mr Pajich-Sweetman followed Lilley and Lenon into the house, thinking he would be installing some of his beloved old-school computer games on to his mate’s computer.</p>
                
                <p>It was there, going through that door about 10.30am, that the last ever image of Mr Pajich-Sweetman alive was captured. The camera also filmed one more sequence.</p>
                
                <p>About 30 minutes later, the motion sensor tripped and filmed Lenon exiting, then entering again, carrying what looked like a big, sheathed knife. It filmed no more, having been turned off by someone from that point. It did not capture the clean-up.</p>
                
                <p>Over the next few days, there were more trips to Bunnings.</p>
                
                <p>And a trip to Rockingham Salvage to pick up ten $5 boxes of floor tiles, which were as red as the patio.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    
                    <p>“I am too scared to say anything ... if I do say anything, they might be able to get my kids and my family, ” she said. “It makes me look guilty as hell — I know what predicament I am in.” </p> 
                                    
                 </blockquote>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Miss Reid was getting worried about Mr Pajich-Sweetman. </p>
                
                <p>He had not come home from his trip to the shops.</p>
                
                <p>His phone was going to voicemail. She looked in all his favourite spots. The college, the park, his gaming haunts, his dad’s. But by Wednesday, it was serious enough to go to the police. By Friday, the police were calling for the public’s help.</p>
                
                <p>Ultimately, though, it was Lenon’s Monday morning call to Mr Pajich-Sweetman, on her own phone, that led police to her door.</p>
                
                <p>Forensic analysis of the call log for Mr Pajich-Sweetman’s number revealed the last number he had spoken to. The number led to an address in Medina, which redirected detectives to 22 Broughton Way.</p>
                
                <p>As Lilley and Lenon arrived home, on the night of June 20, the police were waiting for them.</p>
                
                <p>Lenon’s immediate thought was for her kids. Lilley tried to get on her bike, literally, until detectives stopped her and asked to have a look around her house. </p>

                </div>
                
                <p>She seemed happy to show them around, by the light of a phone torch, even lifting up the tarpaulin down the side of the shed to show them the tiles she had just laid down. As prosecutor James McTaggart told WA’s Supreme Court, the construction looked “frankly, ridiculous”.</p>
                
                <p>So, increasingly, did the two women as police began unpicking their lies in separate interview rooms. Lilley, who had been telling stories and concocting fantasies for years, started with one about a motorbike ride to Mundaring, detailing the route and how the hotel’s hot roast was worth going for. Lenon’s account started with complete denial.</p>
                
                <p>But the questions from Det-Sgt Cameron Blaine were peeling back the layers of lies.</p>
                
                <p>Suddenly, she had spoken to Mr Pajich-Sweetman the morning he went missing. Then he had been in the car. Then he had been at the house but Lenon had gone to sleep and when she woke he was gone.</p>
                
                <p>Then that version started to crumble as well.</p>
                
                <p>“I am too scared to say anything ... if I do say anything, they might be able to get my kids and my family, ” she said. “It makes me look guilty as hell — I know what predicament I am in.”</p>
                
                <p>Two days later, during second interviews, the women’s defences firmed. But it was Lenon who cracked.</p>
                
                <p>“She’s trying to take this fiction into reality — a murder cult — would you agree with that?” Det-Sgt Blaine asked. “Yes ... she often wishes she could just do what she wants but what society doesn’t allow, ” Lenon said.</p>
                
                <p>“Did she ... groom you so on Monday, June 13, you delivered to her Aaron to carry out what she needed to do?” Det-Sgt Blaine asked.</p>
                
                <p>“Yes, ” Lenon said.</p>
